            	<p> My name is Shelagh Cully. I am an illustration major at Towson University and will be graduating in Fall 2015. I currently intern at the Smithsonian's Digital Learning Center creating concept illustrations. I hope to sell my own art work exhibit the world.</p>

        		<p>Did you check out this site when the commercial aired during the Super Bowl? If not you really missed out. This site has a lot of really interesting interactive qualities that I haven't seen on other web pages. This particular example shows a record that folds out from behind two seperate images after you stop scrolling.
